# Paytm : Basic Implementation 


The project is a frontend clone of the Paytm app, built using modern web technologies. It mimics some of the key UI components of the Paytm application, allowing users to navigate through various sections like sending money, checking balance, etc. The project is structured to enhance your understanding of React.js, component-based architecture, and routing using React Router.


## Technologies Used :

**React.js** : The entire project is built using React, taking advantage of its component-based architecture to create reusable UI components.
**React Router**: Used for managing the application's navigation and routing between different pages.  
**Axios**: Possibly used for making HTTP requests to backend services (e.g., initiating transactions, fetching user data).  
**Tailwind CSS**: Custom styles are applied to make the app visually appealing and consistent with the original Paytm design.





## Features :

 - A top navigation bar that displays the app name and user initials.The component is designed using flexbox to align elements horizontally.Responsive design with appropriate use of spacing and alignment.

 - Displays the user's balance in a clear and readable format.Utilizes props to pass the balance value dynamically.

 - A footer-like warning message that contains a label and a button with a link.The button is created using the Link component from react-router-dom to navigate to different routes within the app.

- A page where users can initiate money transfers.Incorporates form handling and validation, possibly with the use of useState for managing input states.
